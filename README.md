# Guesser

This is part tutorial, part personal project that exists as a way to teach myself C#/.NET. 
This is a simple console application that asks the user to guess a randomly generated number between one and ten. 
If the user inputs a word, an error is thrown.
If the user guesses the wrong number, another error is thrown.
If the user guesses the correct number, a success message is thrown.
Finally, upon guessing correctly, the user is asked if they would like to play again.

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
